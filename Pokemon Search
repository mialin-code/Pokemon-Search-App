The Pokémon Search App is a retro-inspired web application that allows users to look up detailed information about any Pokémon using its name or Pokédex ID. 
Has a nostalgic Game Boy aesthetic and it displays stats, types, height, weight, and an official sprite image. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the app fetches real time data from the PokéAPI and offers a fun way to explore Pokémon while practicing API integration and DOM manipulation.
